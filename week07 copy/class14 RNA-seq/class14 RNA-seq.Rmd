## Section 4: One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a population scale. So, you processed about ~230 samples and did the normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find whether there is any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378â€¦) on ORMDL3 expression. 

>Q13. How many samples do we have?

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```
```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```

Lets make a box plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
plot.expr <- ggplot(expr) + aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
plot.expr
```

> Q14. What could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?
Yes, G/G SNP does effect the expression of ORMDL3.
